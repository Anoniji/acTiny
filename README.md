# acTiny

Inspired by jQuery and jQuery UI, acTiny is based on $() as well as the CSS animate library to simplify and modernize jQuery.

# Informations
- acTiny does not need jQuery to work, it is standelone.
- On the other hand, the animate.css file must be imported before the latter to be able to use it
